      <h1>And the world became different – ​​Music since the 20th century </h1>
      <h2>The Impact of Music on Society</h2>
      <p>Music in the 20th and 21st centuries has had a profound impact on social movements and cultural development. From the rebellious sounds of rock 'n' roll in the 1950s to modern music that addresses social justice and political change, music has acted as a mirror of society and often instigated change itself.</p>
      
      <h3>The Role of Music in Social Movements</h3>
      <p>Music has always been a central element of social movements. In the 1960s, music played a key role in the resistance against the Vietnam War, and artists like Bob Dylan became symbols of resistance. Even today, artists like Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar use their music to draw attention to racism and social injustice.</p>

      <h3>Music as Cultural Identity</h3>
      <p>In many parts of the world, music serves as an expression of cultural identity and resistance to political and social oppression. Genres such as reggae, hip-hop and electronic music have become symbols of resistance in certain regions and have helped people share their stories and experiences.</p>

      <h3>Music and Technology: A New Era</h3>
      <p>Advancing technology has changed the way music is produced and consumed. Streaming services, social media and digital music production have enabled artists to reach a global audience. This technological revolution has not only transformed the music industry, but also the way music influences our daily lives.</p>
